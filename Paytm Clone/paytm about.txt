This is a simple CRUD App. The page is divided in to two parts. The first part or the LHS are taken up by the images.
The RHS part is taken up by the simple input form wher you are just going to add a to-do. You can just click on the "Add Todo" to add items.
As soon as you check mark, the css property is going to kick in there.
